          <h3>10) Cross-Border Data Transfer</h3>
          <p>
            We may store or process your Personal Data in a variety of countries

            transferred from within the EU, the UK or Switzerland to ScyllaDB

            appropriate measures to ensure that your Personal Data receives an
            adequate level of data protection upon its transfer. When Personal
            Data collected within the European Economic Area (“<b>EEA</b>“) is
            transferred outside of the EEA to a country that has not received an
            adequacy decision from the European Commission, we will take

            European Union (SCCs). Additionally, following the withdrawal of the
            United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union on January 31, 2020, the
            UK is no longer considered to be a part of the EEA and therefore,
            the transferring of Personal Data from the EEA to the UK is subject
            to and made pursuant with the{" "}
            <a href="">UK standard contractual clauses</a>. In addition to the
            standard contractual clauses mentioned above we are certified under
            the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (“<b>DPF</b>”), the UK Extension to
